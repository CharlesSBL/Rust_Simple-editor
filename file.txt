Once upon a time, in a world not so different from our own, dragons emerged from the depths of ancient caves and hidden mountains. Their sudden appearance sent shockwaves through global politics, but nowhere was the impact felt more strongly than in the United States.

President Eleanor Thompson was in the middle of a routine security briefing when the first reports came in. "Madam President," her Secretary of Defense said, "we have confirmed sightings of what appear to be... dragons... in Wyoming, Arizona, and along the Appalachian range."

The U.S. government quickly established the Federal Dragon Response Agency (FDRA). Initially, military solutions were proposed, but when early communication attempts revealed the dragons to be intelligent beings capable of speech and reasoning, diplomacy took precedence.

Khalazar, the largest dragon and apparent spokesperson for his kind, requested a meeting at the Grand Canyon. There, under the watchful eyes of Secret Service agents and military personnel, President Thompson and Khalazar drafted the first Human-Dragon Accord.

The dragons explained they had hibernated for thousands of years and awakened due to climate change and seismic activity from fracking. They sought peaceful coexistence but needed protected territories and recognition of their sovereignty.

Congress debated fiercely. Some representatives saw opportunity in dragon alliances, while others feared the implications of sharing American soil with giant fire-breathing creatures. Eventually, the Dragon Territories Act passed, establishing five autonomous dragon zones throughout the less populated regions of the country.
